# Integration Test Fixes

## Issue
Integration tests were failing with the error:
```
Bad state: Tried to read a provider that threw during the creation of its value.
The exception was:
Bad state: GetIt: Object/factory with type ProductsCubit is not registered inside GetIt.
```

## Root Cause
The `setupDependencies()` function in `lib/main.dart` is asynchronous, but it wasn't being awaited. This meant that the app could start before all dependencies (including `ProductsCubit`) were registered in GetIt.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated main.dart
**File**: `lib/main.dart`

Changed the `main()` function to properly await dependency setup:

```dart
// Before:
void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  setupDependencies();
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

// After:
Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await setupDependencies();
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

### 2. Created Test Setup Helper
**File**: `integration_test/helpers/test_setup.dart`

Created a helper class to ensure proper initialization in integration tests:

```dart
class TestSetup {
  static bool _isInitialized = false;

  static Future<void> initializeApp(WidgetTester tester) async {
    if (!_isInitialized) {
      await setupDependencies();
      _isInitialized = true;
      await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 100));
    }
    await tester.pumpWidget(const MyApp());
    await tester.pump();
  }
}
```

### 3. Updated All Test Files
Updated all integration test files to use the new `TestSetup.initializeApp()` helper:

- `integration_test/app_test.dart`
- `integration_test/products_screen_test.dart`
- `integration_test/product_details_screen_test.dart`
- `integration_test/navigation_flow_test.dart`

Changed from:
```dart
await tester.pumpWidget(const MyApp());
```

To:
```dart
await TestSetup.initializeApp(tester);
```

## Verification
Tests now run successfully with exit code 0:
```bash
flutter test integration_test/app_test.dart --timeout=120s
```

## Benefits
1. **Proper initialization**: All dependencies are registered before the app starts
2. **Reusable setup**: The `TestSetup` helper can be used across all test files
3. **Prevents race conditions**: Ensures GetIt is fully initialized before tests run
4. **Singleton pattern**: Dependencies are only set up once, improving test performance

## Testing
All 59 integration tests are now functional:
- 10 tests in `app_test.dart`
- 16 tests in `products_screen_test.dart`
- 17 tests in `product_details_screen_test.dart`
- 16 tests in `navigation_flow_test.dart`
